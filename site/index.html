	<div>Dear all,
<span>I took this really cool course
</span></div>
<span>on Coursera.org. I think it's
my favorite course I've EVER taken!
Here is the URL for it:
</span>
<a href="...">HTML, CSS and JS for Web Developers</a>
<div>
Does anyone know how I can give this course 6
out of 5 stars?

Thank you,
